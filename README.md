LionBoard
=========

Simple web dashboard for continuous software localsaition. 

To do list: 
* Work on configuration options (allow more modularity between the dashboard and the Translation Management System/Translation Project Manager, display options, ...)
* Better display format for string template updates (for now all this information is extracted from a log file)
* Integrate XLIFF file support 
* Brainstorm on possible workflows (source string validation, localisation timelines, history for addition and removal of source strings)
* Documentation
